# EasternMarketConnect


# Overview

EasternMarket is an iOS app built using SwiftUI that allows users to explore the Eastern Market in Detroit, Michigan. The app features a map view that displays the various locations within the market, as well as a vendor information view that showcases different vendors and their information.

NOTE: This repository displays my most significant contribution and does not display the full capability of the app which is still being developed
